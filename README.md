# apiai-xamarin-forms-example

Xamarin Forms Sample Application that uses the https://github.com/api-ai natural language processing service.  

This is based on two github projects: https://github.com/api-ai/api-ai-net and https://github.com/api-ai/apiai-xamarin-client

The big difference besides integrating the code from the above repositories into a forms project, is I modified the iOS part to use Speech to text and send the resulting text to the Api.AI services for a result.  

In all cases that I've tried, whether it be Android, iOS, Windows, or Mac based applications I was unable to send a sound file request and by switching the iOS logic to send text instead of a sound file resulting in a working example.
